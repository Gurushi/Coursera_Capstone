    "Tokyo is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Currently ranked 3rd in the global economic power index, Tokyo is definitely one of the best places to start up a new business.During the daytime, specially in the morning and lunch hours, office areas provide huge opportunities for restaurants. Reasonably priced, shops are usually always full during the lunch hours and, given this scenario, we will go through the benefits and pitfalls of opening a breakfast cum lunch restaurant in highly densed office places. Usually the profit margin for a decent restaurant lie within 15âˆ’20% range but, it can even go high enough to 35%. The core of Tokyo is made of 23 wards (municipalities) but, we will concentrate on 5 most busiest business wards of Tokyo to target daily office workers."
